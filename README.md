Searching For Success is a template project that help amateur investor to visualize search trends 
on Google for selected company and get probability that the stock price will increase when 
the quarterly reports will be released for the same company.

To use it as a template for your own project, you will need to clone this
repository into your computer and follow the instructions at the [bottom of this page]

First, let me explain all the different moving parts that make up the
python project, and all the elements which allow us to effectively
share it with others, test it, document it, and track its evolution.

### Organization of the  project

The project has the following structure:  
   * project_name/  
     * |- README.md  
     * |- LICENSE  
     * |- project_name/  
        * |- __init__.py  
        * |- project_name.py
