## 

project_name is a template project...

To use it as a template for your own project, you will need to clone this
repository into your computer and follow the instructions at the [bottom of this page]

First, let me explain all the different moving parts that make up the
python project, and all the elements which allow us to effectively
share it with others, test it, document it, and track its evolution.

### Organization of the  project

The project has the following structure:  
    project_name/  
      |- README.md  
      |- LICENSE  
      |- project_name/  
         |- __init__.py  
         |- project_name.py  
         |- submodule/  
         |- tests/  
            |- __init__.py  
            |- test_core.py  
         |- setup.py   
       |- doc/  
       |- examples/  
            |- demo.ipynb  
           .gitignore  
     
In the following sections we will examine these elements one by one. First,
let's consider the core of the project. This is the code inside of
`**.py`.
