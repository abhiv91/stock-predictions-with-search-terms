## HW6 Description:

#### This homework is about creating a project functional specification. The homework should be done as a group.

#### The functional specification should include the following:
Background. 
  * What problem you're trying to solve. 
  * Why it's important. 
  * How your users will benefit.
Users. 
  * Who will use your system? 
  * What level of computer experience do they require?  
  * What domain knowledge must they have?
Use cases. 
  * How will users interact with the system and how will the system respond.  
  * You likely want to have "mock ups" of screen shots and indicate how users will interact.

The functional specification is typically 3-5 pages.
