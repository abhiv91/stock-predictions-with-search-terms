# Homework 7 - Design Specification and Project Plan
In this homework, you will create a design specification and project plan for your class project. The document should have the following structure:
- Components. This section should list the components that you expect to have in your project (not necessarily a complete list), what they do, and how their interfaces (e.g., functions with inputs and outputs). If the component is an existing package, then you should point to a documentation for the package. If the component is something that you'll build, then describe (maybe at a high level) the functions and their inputs and outputs.
- Interactions. You should have a subsection here for each use case in your functional specification (homework 6). In each subsection, you will describe how the components interact to accomplish the use case.
- Project plan. Provide details for what you'll accomplish in the next two weeks, and higher level descriptions for the remaining weeks in the quarter so that the end result is that you have implemented and tested a system that accomplishes your use cases.
