""""Prediction of Stock Price Docstring

This mocdule implement three functions: feature_selection,
prediction_model and prediction_stock_price. The first function,
featues_selection will use Lasso regression model to select
6 keywords that are significant to the company's stock performance.
And the second function predcition_model will predict the
likelihood of stock prices increase or decrease after upcomming
earning report released for given company. And the third function
prediction _stock_price will call the previous functions
based on the company name input.
