"""Prediction of Stock Price Docstring

This mocdule implement two functions: feature_selection
and prediction_model. The first function, featues_selection will
use Lasso regression model to select keywords that are significant
to the company's stock performance. And the second function predcition_model
will predict the likelihood of stock prices increase or decrease
after upcomming earning report released for given company.
