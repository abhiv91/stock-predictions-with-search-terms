    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the events that effect the stock market are inherently unpredictable. Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and Donald Trump's tweets all ensure unforeseeable short term market changes at some point. Then, in our world of supercomputers, market oscillation is frequently amplified by high-frequency trading (HFT). HFT is catch-all term for different algorithmic investing strategies. But in general, HFT consists of short holding periods (days to seconds), along with massive computational, trading, and information technology infrastructure. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, even miles away from Wall Street, algorithmic trading is commonly used. In fact, sites like www.quantopian.com, provide starter Python code, basic market data, and tutorials to help the masses implement their own trading models. From the site:\n",
    ">\tQuantopian inspires talented people everywhere to write investment algorithms.\n",
    ">\tSelect authors may license their algorithms to us and get paid based on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attempt to predict market fluctuations based on past performance is not new, but today large amounts of data are more accessible to the masses. Trend detection looks for gradual changes in key indicator variables over time to predict future behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "While, predicting the direction a company's stock price will move on any given day is impossible. There are cyclical events, like the release of quarterly earnings reports, where more often than not, if the earnings exceed expectations, the stock price goes up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Newspapers, magazines, cable networks, blogs, and the government all spend time poring over economic surveys and indicators. For example, on the first Friday of each month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics releases its monthly unemployment report and nonfarm payroll, quantifying how many jobs have been gained or lost within the United States' economy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Blogs, scholarly journals, and how to investment guides are replete with methods for quantifying investor sentiment and its relation to near-term stock market returns. In fact, one article analyzed “whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time.” Johan Bollen, Huina Mao, Xiaojun Zeng, Twitter mood predicts the stock market, Journal of Computational Science, Volume 2, Issue 1, March 2011, Pages 1-8, ISSN 1877-7503, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2010.12.007  \n",
    "\n",
    "Closer, to our own project, another article asserts “that daily trading volumes of stocks traded in NASDAQ-100 are correlated with daily volumes of queries related to the same stocks. In particular, query volumes anticipate in many cases peaks of trading by one day or more.” Bordino I, Battiston S, Caldarelli G, Cristelli M, Ukkonen A, et al. (2012) Web Search Queries Can Predict Stock Market Volumes. PLOS ONE 7(7): e40014. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0040014 Bordino used queries submitted to the Yahoo! search engine that are related to companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange and then performed time-lagged cross-correlation analysis and the Granger-causality test.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another article measured internet search queries related to the leading stock market index, and found co-movement of the Dow Jones’ volatility and the volume of search queries for its name. Dimpfl, T. and Jank, S. (2016), Can Internet Search Queries Help to Predict Stock Market Volatility?. Eur Financial Management, 22: 171–192. doi:10.1111/eufm.12058. Interestingly, they note that “[r]etail investors are often considered to be uninformed noise traders,” yet they concluded, “that search queries are strongly contemporaneously correlated with market volatility and that search queries today (positively) predict volatility tomorrow.” p. 173  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the reasonably well established, short-term market response to company earnings reports, our preliminary goal is to develop models to predict whether the earnings report will be positive or negative. In the future, we would like to predict whether the actual earnings per share (EPS) report beats analyst expectations, but that is a very long stretch goal. EPS is a company's earnings over a specific time period (quarterly or annually) divided by the total number of shares outstanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Federal securities laws require publicly traded companies to disclose information on an ongoing basis, and this disclosure happens when they file reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Large, publicly-traded companies file both annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (filed for the first three quarters each year). The reports are available at the SEC’s website: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html"

    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we are going to focus on five technology companies, each of them has been publicly traded for at least 10 years so we have sufficient training data to develop our model. We will also consider each company's performance in the context of the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ exchange over the same period.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to Google Trend data, our predictor data will include the daily stock price and the percent of price fluxuation each day over each quarter (or possibly the last 90 days if the prediction is being made less than 21 days into the current quarter).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We anticipate using a pool of common terms signifying positive or negative interest and pairing those terms with  company specific identifer terms to retrieve the respective Google Trends search results. Possible terms to be used for all companies in an effort to quantify the amount of positive or negative interest:  \n",
    "common_pos_terms = [\"how to\", \"register\", \"order\", \"preorder\", \"pre-order\"]  \n",
    "common_neg_terms = [\"error\", \"problem\", \"recall\", \"appologize\", \"suck\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", \"evil\"]  \n",
    "\n",
    "Google Trends search results for keywords tailored to each company. \n",
    "For example, take Amazon, possible keywords include:  \n",
    "amazon_ID_terms = [\"Amazon\", \"Bezos\", \"Seattle Tech\", \"Amazon Web\"]  \n",
    "amazon_product_terms = [\"Alexa\", \"Echo\", \"Kindle\", \"Kindle HD\", \"Fire\", \"Amazon Web Services,\" \"AWS\"]  \n",
    "\n",
    "For training purposes, our response variable is the last 10 years of quarterly EPS reports. While, EPS can be measured three ways, in its 10-Q quarterly reports to the SEC, Amazon reported both basic EPS and diluted EPS. For 2017 Q1, basic EPS was 1.52 and diluted EPS was 1.48. We intend to use diluted EPS since it divides by the total ordinary and special shares outstanding.\n"
